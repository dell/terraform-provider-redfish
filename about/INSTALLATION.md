# Installation of Terraform Provider for RedFish

## Installation from public repository

The provider will be fetched from the public repository and installed by Terraform automatically.
Create a file called `main.tf` in your workspace with the following contents

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    redfish = {
      version = "1.6.0"
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/dell/redfish"
    }
  }
}
```
Then, in that workspace, run
```
terraform init
``` 

## Installation from source code

1. Clone this [redfish](https://github.com/dell/terraform-provider-redfish) repo 
2. In the root of this repo run
```
make install
```
Then follow [installation from public repo](#installation-from-public-repository)
