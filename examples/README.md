# Examples

This directory contains examples that are mostly used for documentation, but can also be run/tested manually via the Terraform CLI.

For developers who wish to extend this provider:
The tool [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs) is used as our documentation generator and it reads examples from this folder.
Please refer [conventional paths](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#conventional-paths) to understand which files in this folder are read into the documentation and which are ignored.
