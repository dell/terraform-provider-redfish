After the successful execution of the above resource block, Bios configuration would have been altered. It can be verified through state file.

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of String) The Bios attribute map.
- `bios_job_timeout` (Number) bios_job_timeout is the time in seconds that the provider waits for the bios update job to becompleted before timing out.
- `redfish_server` (Block List) List of server BMCs and their respective user credentials (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--redfish_server))
- `reset_timeout` (Number) reset_timeout is the time in seconds that the provider waits for the server to be reset before timing out.
- `reset_type` (String) Reset type to apply on the computer system after the BIOS settings are applied. Applicable values are 'ForceRestart', 'GracefulRestart', and 'PowerCycle'.Default = "GracefulRestart".
- `settings_apply_time` (String) The time when the BIOS settings can be applied. Applicable value is 'OnReset' only. In upcoming releases other apply time values will be supported. Default is "OnReset".
- `system_id` (String) System ID of the system

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--redfish_server"></a>
### Nested Schema for `redfish_server`

Optional:

- `endpoint` (String) Server BMC IP address or hostname
- `password` (String, Sensitive) User password for login
- `redfish_alias` (String) Alias name for server BMCs. The key in provider's `redfish_servers` map
- `ssl_insecure` (Boolean) This field indicates whether the SSL/TLS certificate must be verified or not
- `user` (String) User name for login

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

terraform import redfish_bios.bios "{\"username\":\"<username>\",\"password\":\"<password>\",\"endpoint\":\"<endpoint>\",\"ssl_insecure\":<true/false>}"

# terraform import with redfish_alias. When using redfish_alias, provider's `redfish_servers` is required.
# redfish_alias is used to align with enhancements to password management.
terraform import redfish_bios.bios "{\"redfish_alias\":\"<redfish_alias>\"}"
```

1. This will import the storage volume instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
