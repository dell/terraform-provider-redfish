# redfish_user_account (Resource)

This Terraform resource is used to manage user entity of the iDRAC Server. We can create, read, modify and delete an existing user using this resource.

~> **Note:** In the absence of `user_id`, first available `user_id` is assigned to the given user.

~> **Note:** For managing (Create/Update/Delete/Change password) a single user at a time, use the resource 'redfish_user_account'

~> **Note:** For managing (Create/Update/Delete/Change password) multiple users at a time, use the module 'user_module'

~> **Note:** For changing the password of Administrator/root user alone, use the resource 'user_account_password'

Upon successful execution of the preceding resource block, a new user account will be established, provided it does not preexist. The creation can be confirmed by examining the state file.

terraform import redfish_user_account.rr "{\"id\":\"<id>\",\"username\":\"<username>\",\"password\":\"<password>\",\"endpoint\":\"<endpoint>\",\"ssl_insecure\":<true/false>}"

# terraform import with redfish_alias. When using redfish_alias, provider's `redfish_servers` is required.
# redfish_alias is used to align with enhancements to password management.
terraform import redfish_user_account.rr "{\"id\":\"<id>\",\"redfish_alias\":\"<redfish_alias>\"}"
```

1. This will import the user instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
