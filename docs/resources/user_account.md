```

After the successful execution of the above resource block, a new user would have been created, if not already present. It can be verified through state file.

```shell

*/

terraform import redfish_user_account.rr "{\"id\":\"<id>\",\"username\":\"<username>\",\"password\":\"<password>\",\"endpoint\":\"<endpoint>\",\"ssl_insecure\":<true/false>}"
```

1. This will import the user instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
